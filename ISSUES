# Increased support for relative directions is necessary.

We want to allow getNextMove() (in class Brain) to be able to return a 
relative direction, and not necessarily an absolute one (perhaps even
-only- a relative direction). To allow this, an overhaul of the 
Direction class might be necessary.

# How to determine starting locations of snakes?

An algorithm for this is needed. Do we want them to spawn in fixed
locations, or should it be random? Is there a maximum limit to the 
number of players?

Take a look at this illustration of a board below (X represents an
empty square, numbers each represent a snake). This could easily 
be extended to accommodate for more players, as long as the board 
size is increased.

# Main needs restructuring; code needs to be where it belongs.

Right now, Main.java creates a SettingsWindow object, which in turn 
creates a MainWindow object, both located in the userInterface package. 
Main should instead create a Session and a MainWindow, and also run
the main loop.
