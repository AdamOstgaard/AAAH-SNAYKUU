# Developer mode shouldn't output to terminal

Also, it should run in its own thread so that it doesn't freeze the
entire interface.


# Expand the snake placement algorithm

As of now, getting starting positions for the snakes is simple, but only
if we want them to start at a size of 1. When snakes are placed on the
board, we want them to be able to occupy more than one space from the 
beginning. One possibility is to expand the snake's body somehow from the
starting head position.
Also, the snakes' starting directions needs to be more cleverly decided.
Right now, they all move towards Direction.NORTH, but this won't work if
we want snakes to be able to spawn larger than one square.


# Two snakes using same brain

Two snakes should be able to use the same brain class, but not the same
brain instance. The class loader should also be able to reload a brain
between two games.


# Improve PostGameWindow

- Allow starting a new game from within without having to restart the entire
program (both rematches and be able to change settings in between).
- Add more statistics (?)
- De-uglify.


# Replay

Fix the replay system. We need to create a JFrame for this.


# Kills

Snakes will get one point for each kill. This does however not affect
the game result
